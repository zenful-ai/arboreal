// Package main is a learning-purposes example, NOT a template for real apps.
//
// It shows the smallest complete pass through Arboreal's planning machinery: a
// TodoListExecutive that plans a todo list for a single request and executes
// that plan exactly once.
//
// This is the "one-shot" counterpart to the executive's RunLoop. RunLoop sits
// on a channel and, for every incoming message, plans and executes over and
// over — a conversation. Here we skip the loop: Call on the executive performs
// one Plan (the LLM turns the request into a todo list of named behaviors) and
// one Execute (each planned step runs, and the results are summarized into a
// single answer). Prompt in, plan, answer out, done.
//
// Requires OPENAI_TOKEN to be set in the environment (the default model is
// gpt-4o-mini via the OpenAI provider).
