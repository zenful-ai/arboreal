// Package main is a learning-purposes example, NOT a template for real apps.
//
// It shows the TodoListExecutive doing what it exists for: choosing between
// several behaviors. The executive holds two behavior trees — one writes
// haikus, one writes sonnets — and an out-of-bounds handler for everything
// else. On every user message the executive's planner (an LLM call) picks
// which behaviors to run, from their names and descriptions.
//
// Try these, submitting each with a line containing only "$":
//
//   - "A haiku about autumn rain"         → one step, write_haiku (its
//     output still passes through the executive's summarizer)
//   - "A haiku and a sonnet about the sea" → two steps, run concurrently,
//     then merged into one reply by the executive's summarizer
//   - "What's the weather like?"          → an empty plan, so the
//     out-of-bounds handler answers
//
// If the planner invents a step name that is not one of the two behaviors,
// Plan panics with `No plan named ... found!`. That is a framework sharp
// edge, not a mistake in this file; run it again.
//
// The planner sees each behavior's name and description, plus the FIRST
// behavior's example (shown once as a sample direction) — never its states.
// So name and description are the whole interface between your trees and the
// planning LLM; write them the way you would write a tool description.
//
// Requires OPENAI_TOKEN to be set in the environment (the default model is
// gpt-4o-mini via the OpenAI provider). Stop the program with Ctrl-C. Ctrl-D
// does not end it: TerminalChannel reports end of input as an empty message
// and RunLoop keeps planning replies to it (each one a paid model call), so
// never pipe input into this program.
