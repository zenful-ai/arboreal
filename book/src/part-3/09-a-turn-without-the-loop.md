# A turn without the loop

Every agent in Parts I and II ran the same way: `RunLoop` owned a terminal, blocked until you typed, and kept the conversation alive for as long as the process ran. That shape fits a chat window and almost nothing else. In most deployments a message arrives as its own event — from a queue, a webhook, a job — and lands in a process that handles one message per invocation. That process does not own the conversation; it must pick the conversation up, run one turn, and get out, and the next message may land in a different process entirely.

Part III is everything that makes that work. This chapter finds the per-message API that has been hiding in Chapter 8 and keeps Chapter 2's promise by reducing `RunLoop` to a few lines around it. Chapter 10 makes a conversation survive a process exit, so the next turn can run somewhere else. Chapter 11 watches a turn while it runs. Chapter 12 gives states tools. Chapter 13 says what can be tested without a model on the wire.

## Why this exists

`RunLoop` in `executive.go` is a `for` loop with no exit condition over a blocking `Channel.Receive`. That is the right shape exactly when the process owns the conversation end to end: something has to sit and wait for the next message, and the loop is that something. In a process that handles one message per invocation there is nothing to sit and wait *on*. The message is already in hand when the process starts, and when the turn is over the process should return, not block. The loop is not wrong there; it is unemployable.

The per-message API has been in front of us since Chapter 8. Its section "`Call` and `RunLoop` are twins" said the two methods run the same turn, and `examples/oneshot` already drove a single turn through `Call`. What that chapter did not establish is that `Call` is the only correct way to drive turn after turn without the loop. This chapter does.

## The anatomy of `Call`

`Call(ctx, messages)` in `executive.go` does four things. If the plan is empty, it calls `Plan(ctx, messages)`. Otherwise it takes the resume branch: for each pending step it appends `*messages.LastMessage()` — the message the caller just added — to that step's `Messages`, and no planning happens. Then `Execute(ctx, messages)`. Then it appends `e.Output` to the list as an assistant-role message and returns the list, with a signal that is always `nil`, all inside the trace envelope from Chapter 5. This is Chapter 8's twins section one level down, and the level down is where the contract lives: every read and write goes through the `messages` argument. `Call` works on the list it is given, and the executive's `History` field never appears in its body.

That last point deserves a table. Of the four methods on the turn path, exactly one touches `History`:

| Method | Reads `History`? | Writes `History`? |
|---|---|---|
| `Plan` | no | no |
| `Execute` | no | no |
| `Call` | no | no |
| `RunLoop` | yes | yes |

The transcript, in other words, is the caller's job. `RunLoop` is one such caller: it appends what `Receive` returned and what `Execute` produced to `e.History` and runs the turn on that field. Without the loop, you keep the list yourself — append the user's message, hand the list to `Call`, keep what comes back. (The table is about the field. `Execute`'s re-plan path does rewrite the last message of whatever list it is handed — Chapter 8 traced that — so a caller's transcript can still be edited through the argument; but no method except `RunLoop` names `e.History`.)

Could you go lower and call `Plan` and `Execute` yourself? On the first turn, yes: that pair is exactly what `Call` runs when the plan is empty, minus the envelope and the final append. From the second turn on, no, for two reasons both visible in `Plan`. First, `Plan` begins by discarding any plan in flight: its first act after rendering the planner prompt is to reset `e.plan` to an empty slice, so if a step paused last turn, calling `Plan` erases it before the planner even answers. Second, the field is `plan`, unexported. The resume branch — append the new message to each pending step's `Messages` — reads and writes state your code cannot reach from outside the package, so it cannot be written by hand at all. "Plan then Execute" is therefore a first-turn-only idiom; `Call` is that same pair with the resume branch included, and it is the only method that has one.

One corner carries over from Chapter 8: `Execute` with an empty plan is not a no-op. It hands the last message to `OutOfBoundsHandler`, or, with none set, makes `Output` the literal `Please set an out-of-bounds handler, this request was unable to be planned.` — the first case of that chapter's `Execute` walkthrough. An empty plan is a routed outcome, not an idle one, and a per-message caller sends its result to the user like any other reply.

## Run it

`examples/one-turn` is the quickstart executive — one tree, `chatState` then `pauseState` — driven for two turns with no loop, no channel, and a transcript carried by hand. `buildExecutive` is Chapter 1 unchanged:

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/one-turn/main.go:build}}
```

`turn` is one message's worth of work: append the user's words to the transcript we own, run `Call` once, hand back the transcript with the reply appended. `Call`'s signal is always `nil`, so it is dropped:

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/one-turn/main.go:turn}}
```

`main` runs two turns and prints the transcript:

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/one-turn/main.go:main}}
```

Run it with `go run ./examples/one-turn`; it needs `OPENAI_TOKEN` and exits on its own. One run printed the following — the model's wording varies between runs:

```text
[0] user      Hi, I'm Paul. Please remember my name.
[1] assistant I'm sorry, but I can't remember personal information such as names for future interactions. However, I'm here to help you with anything you need right now! How can I assist you today, Paul?
[2] user      What is my name?
[3] assistant Your name is Paul. How can I assist you today?
```

Read the output against the anatomy. The first turn planned: the plan was empty, so `Call` called `Plan`, the planner wrote a direction for `chat_behavior`, `chatState` replied, `pauseState` paused, and the kept step's last message became `Output` — message `[1]`. The model even protests that it cannot remember a name; the framework then remembers for it, because the pause kept the step and its message list alive on the executive. The second turn resumed: the plan held one step, so `Call` skipped `Plan` and routed `What is my name?` into the pending step, whose `Messages` already held the first exchange — the direction that carried the name, and the protest. The model saw a conversation and answered it — message `[3]`.

Everything here lives in one process. The transcript is ours, but the thing that made turn two work — the paused step, its growing message list, its tree copy — sits in the unexported `plan` field of an executive in memory. Put a process exit between the two turns and it is gone. For the next message to land in a fresh process, the pending plan has to survive as data. That is Chapter 10.

## `RunLoop`, revisited

Here is all of `RunLoop`, from `executive.go`, trimmed of nothing:

```go
func (e *TodoListExecutive) RunLoop(ctx context.Context, c Channel) error {
	for {
		cm, err := c.Receive()
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		e.History = AppendToMessages(e.History, llm.ChatCompletionMessage{
			Role:    llm.ChatMessageRoleUser,
			Content: cm.Content,
		})

		if len(e.plan) == 0 {
			e.Plan(ctx, e.History)
		} else {
			for _, step := range e.plan {
				step.Messages = append(step.Messages, *e.History.LastMessage())
			}
		}

		e.Execute(ctx, e.History)

		e.History = AppendToMessages(e.History, llm.ChatCompletionMessage{
			Role:    llm.ChatMessageRoleAssistant,
			Content: e.Output,
		})

		err = c.Send(&ChannelMessage{
			Id:      cm.Id,
			Content: e.Output,
		})
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}
}
```

Read it top to bottom: receive; append the user's message to `History`; the same plan-or-resume as `Call`, run on `e.History` instead of an argument; `Execute`; append `Output` to `History`; send. Every mechanism the loop exercises belongs to `Call`'s turn. What the loop adds is the channel and the upkeep of `History` — precisely the two things that are the caller's job everywhere else in Part III.

The `Channel` interface — `AllocateID`, `Send`, `Receive` in `channel.go` — exists for this loop style, and the framework ships two implementations: the `TerminalChannel` you have been typing into, and `TwilioSMSChannel`, which buffers webhook posts into a Go channel so that `Receive` has something to block on. This book does not cover them further.

## Coming from LangGraph

`Call` is `compiled_graph.invoke` with no checkpointer configured: nothing saves state for you, so you thread it yourself — and the state here is the transcript, passed in with the new message appended, taken back with the reply appended, and handed to the next invocation. `RunLoop` is the `while True:` REPL a tutorial wraps around `invoke` to make a chat demo. What LangGraph splits between a checkpointer and a `thread_id` — where a conversation's state lives, and which conversation a message belongs to — Arboreal splits between your transcript and Chapter 10's snapshots: you carry the conversation you would show the user, and the snapshot carries the paused plan.

## Sharp edges

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
Calling `Plan` on an executive with a plan in flight destroys the plan: its first act is to reset the list. A paused conversation planned again is a conversation forgotten. After turn one, go through `Call`.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
`Call` never touches `History`. If anything downstream reads the executive's own transcript — `TakeSnapshot` does (Chapter 10) — you must assign `History` yourself, before or after `Call`. Forgetting is silent: everything works until a restore comes back empty.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
`Call` always returns `nil` as its signal, even when a step paused inside. From the outside you cannot ask "is this conversation waiting on the user?" — the snapshot is how you find out (Chapter 10).
```

## Back to the trace

Chapter 2 numbered the seven steps of a turn and promised that this chapter would reduce `RunLoop` to a few lines around `Call`. The lines are above; here is the accounting. Steps 2 through 5 — `Plan`, the fan-out in `executePlan`, the tree walk, the reply decision — are exactly what `Call` runs. Step 1's `Receive` and step 6's `Send` are gone; there is no channel. The appends `RunLoop` made to `History` — the user's message in steps 1 and 7, the `Output` in step 6 — become appends to the caller's own transcript: in `examples/one-turn`, `turn` makes the first before calling `Call`, and `Call` itself makes the second onto the list it returns. And step 7's resume — skip `Plan`, append the new message to the paused step's `Messages`, `Execute` again — is `Call`'s else branch. Nothing on Chapter 2's page belonged to the loop. The loop just called it.

```admonish example title="Recap"
- `Call` is the per-message turn: plan or resume, execute, append the output.
- The transcript is yours: no method but `RunLoop` maintains `History`.
- `Plan` wipes an in-flight plan; `plan` is private — after turn one, only `Call`.
- An empty plan at `Execute` means the out-of-bounds path, not a no-op.
```
