# Testing agents

## Why this exists

Strip a turn to its model calls and there are two or three: the planner, the state that writes the reply, sometimes a summarizer. Everything else in this book — the walk order, the signal triage, the annotations riding on messages, the templates that build prompts, the snapshot round trip — is deterministic Go, and deterministic Go is what `go test` was built for. The temptation coming from other frameworks is to mock the model and test the whole agent; Arboreal, as the What you cannot stub section below shows, does not offer that seam. What it offers instead is a wide hermetic zone around a narrow model edge: lambda states make trees walkable without a token, `Restore` puts a plan in flight without a planner, and any logic you keep in plain functions over `AnnotatedMessages` tests like the ordinary code it is. This chapter maps the zone from the inside out — what tests without a model, then the edge where nothing does.

## What tests without a model

### Trees and signals

Chapter 6's `examples/signals` walked a six-state tree of recorder lambdas — each appends its name to a shared slice and returns the signal it was built with — and printed the order. The same example ships `main_test.go`, which turns those printed runs into a table test. First, one predicate per outcome:

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/signals/main_test.go:predicates}}
```

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/signals/main_test.go:cases}}
```

Each row is one of Chapter 6's scenarios: the signals to plant, how many `Call`s to make, the visit order expected from each call, and a predicate for the signal each call hands back. The example's `exercise` helper — Chapter 6 included it — builds a fresh tree per row, seeds a one-message history (a state must never see an empty one — `BehaviorState.Call` reads the last message after the lambda runs), and threads the history through the calls, so the pause row really is two calls on one tree, and the `a2 a1 b b1` resume order — reverse of insertion, Chapter 6's third sharp edge — is pinned by an assertion instead of a paragraph. Note what the predicates assert: not "a skip happened" but that the returned value type-asserts to `*arboreal.SkipSignal`, the *pointer* type. The framework's own switches match only pointer signal types, so a lambda returning `SkipSignal{}` by value misbehaves at runtime while compiling clean — and this predicate is precisely the test that catches it.

### Logic over histories

The states worth having usually wrap a plain function, and the plain function is where the tests go. `examples/little-spy` reads the facts its extractor states annotated onto the conversation through a single function, `learned(messages)`: walk the messages oldest to newest, collect the annotations named in `factKeys`, skip every shape the extractors use for "not found", and let a later answer overwrite an earlier one. It takes `AnnotatedMessages` and returns `map[string]string` — no state, no context, no model — so its test needs only a way to build annotated messages by hand:

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/little-spy/main_test.go:helper}}
```

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/little-spy/main_test.go:merge}}
```

The file's second test, `TestLearnedIgnoresUnknownAndKeepsLatest`, is Chapter 4's sharp edges recast as table rows: an age arriving as `float64(34)`, because `Annotation.Data` that has been through a snapshot comes back in JSON shapes; a first name arriving as the literal string `{"data": null}`, because `evalIntoAnnotation` stores the raw JSON when the model answers null. Both must be tolerated, and the test proves `learned` tolerates them — the `float64` normalized by `fmt.Sprint`, the brace-prefixed string skipped as a miss. A third test feeds only the framework's own annotations (`__trace_annotations`, `plan`) and expects an empty map: iterate by the names you own, and prove it. None of this required running the spy; it required keeping the merge out of the lambda and in a function.

### Templates

Chapter 4 explored `AnnotationTemplate` with a probe program, `examples/annotation-template`, that printed renderings for a human to read. The same `Parse`/`Execute` pair asserts just as well: build a history by hand, annotate it, render, compare. This one is small and chapter-specific enough to live inline rather than in an example:

```go
func TestTemplateForms(t *testing.T) {
	h := arboreal.AppendToMessages(nil, llm.ChatCompletionMessage{
		Role: llm.ChatMessageRoleUser, Content: "Something warm, please.",
	})
	h[0].Annotations["name"] = arboreal.Annotation{Data: "Joe"}

	var tmpl arboreal.AnnotationTemplate
	if _, err := tmpl.Parse("Hello {{ name }}.{{ Preference: pref? }}"); err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}
	var out strings.Builder
	if err := tmpl.Execute(&out, h); err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}
	if got, want := out.String(), "Hello Joe."; got != want {
		t.Fatalf("rendered %q, want %q", got, want)
	}
}
```

`AppendToMessages` initializes the `Annotations` map, which is why the assignment on the next line is safe on a freshly built history. The template exercises two of Chapter 4's forms at once: the required `{{ name }}` renders its annotation, and the optional multi-word block `{{ Preference: pref? }}` vanishes whole because `pref` is absent — asserted by the exact string, not eyeballed. This matters more than it looks: `LLMCompletionState` runs every `System` option through exactly this code before every model call, so a test like this is a test of your prompts. The tokenizer traps from Chapter 4's sharp edges — an apostrophe or a URL inside a block — fail loudly under assertion instead of quietly in production.

### Snapshots, and seeding a plan

The executive's `plan` field is unexported, so a test cannot hand it a paused step directly — and without one, `Call` heads straight into `Plan`, which is a model call. Chapter 10 crafted a snapshot by hand and noted that seeding via `Restore` is the only way to put a plan in flight from outside the package, promising this chapter would turn that into a testing technique. Here it is, from `examples/snapshot-edges`' own `main_test.go`:

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/snapshot-edges/main_test.go:roundtrip}}
```

The pattern is the probe made rigorous: build the executive with pinned ids, `Restore` a crafted snapshot to seed the plan, append a user message, `Call`. The seeded plan makes `Call` take the resume branch — no planner — and the tree's canned state makes step execution model-free, so the whole turn is hermetic. The test then goes one leg further than the probe: it snapshots the paused executive, restores into a *second* freshly built one, and runs the same turn there, asserting the same reply — the round trip itself under test, in a package that imports no provider and needs no token.

One aside on ids, since a crafted snapshot and a built executive must agree on them. Chapter 5 covered the generator: `GenerateStringIdentifier` draws from `crypto/rand` unless `ZEN_SEED_RNG` seeds it, so under the knob a test *can* predict an id it did not assign. Prefer not to need that: assign ids explicitly, as `snapshot-edges` pins `exec-edges` and `tree-greeter` through its constructor, and the question of what the generator will produce never arises. The env knob is a last resort, and the first sharp edge below says why.

## What you cannot stub

The model is not injectable. `LLMCompletionState`'s lambda constructs its provider inside itself — `llm.CreateModelProvider(options.Model, llm.ProviderOpenAI)` in `state.go` — on every call: there is no provider field on `LLMCompletionOptions`, no constructor parameter, and no context key a test could hang a fake on. Annotation mode is the same seam-free shape; `evalIntoAnnotation` builds its own provider the same way. And the planner is out of reach twice over: `Plan` in `executive.go` builds its own `LLMCompletionState` with `Annotation: "plan"` and calls its lambda directly, so planning always means a real model. That is the framework as it stands; this book documents it rather than pretending otherwise.

The workaround is structural, and it is the shape every hermetic test above already relies on. Keep model states thin — a prompt in, text or one annotation out — and put every branch, lookup, and merge in lambda states and plain functions around them, where the tests in this chapter reach. `little-spy`'s extractors are thin by construction (one system prompt, one annotation); everything the agent *does* with the extracted facts lives in `learned`, which tests in microseconds. What remains untestable without spending a token is then exactly the part a stub would tell you nothing about anyway: whether the model, given the prompt your template test proved it receives, exercises good judgment. That question has no hermetic answer, from any framework.

## Coming from LangGraph

The habit that does not transfer is `FakeListLLM` — binding a mock model that replays canned responses and asserting the graph's behavior around it. Arboreal has no equivalent because the provider is constructed inside the state, not passed to it; there is nothing to bind. The leverage point moves accordingly: instead of *swapping the model*, you *shrink what touches the model*, until the untested remainder is a thin prompt-to-text seam. The idiom that does transfer is seeding: where a LangGraph test hands a checkpointer a prepared state and invokes from there, an Arboreal test hands `Restore` a crafted snapshot and `Call`s — same move, with the snapshot map playing the checkpoint and your constructor's pinned ids playing the `thread_id`'s half of the contract.

## Sharp edges

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
`ZEN_SEED_RNG` is process-wide: set it in one test and every later `GenerateStringIdentifier` call in the binary follows the seeded sequence, so id expectations depend on test order. Set it in `TestMain` or not at all.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
Copying a state copies its `HashId` (Chapter 5). In table-driven tests that build many trees from shared state values, two trees sharing one id can restore each other's snapshots; regenerate or assign ids per instance.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
Returning a signal by value instead of by pointer is a bug the compiler mostly lets through — every framework switch matches pointer types, and `BehaviorState.Call` feeds each returned signal through `TraceForSignal`, which panics with `unknown Signal type` on a value, tracer or no tracer (Chapter 6; `examples/crm` does this). A one-line test per lambda asserting the returned signal's type reports the mistake by name instead of by panic; the signals test's predicates are that assertion, ready to copy.
```

## Back to the trace

Lay this chapter over Chapter 2's seven steps and the hermetic zone has a clean boundary. The snapshot round-trip test runs steps 3 through 6: step 3's fan-out over the seeded plan, step 4's walk with the model call replaced by a canned state at the state boundary, step 5's triage keeping the paused step and taking the single-step shortcut, and step 6 minus its `Send`: `Call` appends the reply itself, and the test's assertions stand in for the channel. Step 2 — the planner — is the model edge, which is why the test enters through `Restore` instead; and step 5's other path, the summarizer that fires when the shortcut does not, is the same edge in different clothes. Everything the trace showed as framework machinery tests without a token; the two model calls the executive makes on its own — the planner, the summarizer — are the two places nothing here can follow.

```admonish example title="Recap"
- Hermetic: walks and signals, history logic, templates, snapshot round-trips.
- Seed a paused conversation through `Restore`; assign ids, don't mine them.
- Not stubable: the provider inside `LLMCompletionState`, the planner. Keep model states thin.
```
