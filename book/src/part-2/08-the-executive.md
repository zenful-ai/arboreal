# The executive

## Why this exists

One tree handles one kind of request: Chapter 7's trees greet and answer, or extract and look up. An assistant has to handle many kinds, and something has to decide, message by message, which of them applies. The `TodoListExecutive` in `executive.go` is that something. It holds a flat list of behaviors, asks a model which of them to run for the current message and with what instruction, runs the chosen ones concurrently on copies, and turns their results into one reply. It is also the object that owns the conversation across turns: `History` lives on it, and so does the list of steps still waiting on the user, which is why a later message can go to a paused tree instead of back to the planner. And it is itself a `Behavior`, so an executive can sit inside a tree, or, wrapped in a one-state tree, inside another executive's plan, with the limits Chapter 7 gave for nesting and a few of its own listed below.

## The struct

```go
type TodoListExecutive struct {
    ExecName, ExecDescription string
    Preamble           string             // template, prepended to the planner and summarizer prompts
    Behaviors          []Behavior         // what the planner may choose from — in practice, *BehaviorTree only
    OutOfBoundsHandler Behavior           // runs when the plan is empty
    MaxPlanDepth       int                // re-plan recursion cap, default 3
    History            AnnotatedMessages  // the transcript
    ClientID           string
    Output             string             // this turn's reply (set by Execute)
    // unexported: plan []*ExecGeneratedStep, planDepth int, hash string
}
```

`CreateTodoListExecutive(name, description, behaviors...)` fills `ExecName`, `ExecDescription` and `Behaviors`, sets `MaxPlanDepth` to `DefaultMaxPlanDepth`, which is 3, and draws a random hash with `GenerateStringIdentifier`, as the state and tree factories do. `CreateTodoListExecutiveWithId` takes the hash as a third argument, before the behaviors, and pins it for snapshots (Part III). Everything else is set afterwards by assigning to the field, as `examples/poetry` does with `Preamble` and `OutOfBoundsHandler`. `ExecName` and `ExecDescription` back `Name()` and `Description()` and appear on trace messages; no prompt reads them (Chapter 5).

A plan step is an `ExecGeneratedStep{Behavior, Messages, ReplanTombstone}`: the `Copy()` of the chosen behavior, the message list that copy is called with, and a flag marking the reserved `Re-plan` step, which has no behavior. The unexported fields are what the struct carries between turns: `plan`, the steps still pending; `planDepth`, how many re-plans deep the current turn is; and `hash`.

## Run it

### One shot

`examples/oneshot` is the executive with no loop at all: one behavior, one `Call`, one printed line. `Call` plans, executes, and returns the history it was given with the reply appended as an assistant message.

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/oneshot/main.go}}
```

Run it with `go run ./examples/oneshot`; it needs `OPENAI_TOKEN` and exits on its own. One run printed:

```text
The capital of France is Paris. It's known for its rich history, art, culture, and landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral.
```

Three model calls: the planner, the tree's one state, and — since no step was left pending — the summarizer. Note what the example does not set: no `Preamble` and no `OutOfBoundsHandler`. Both omissions are sharp edges below.

### Choosing between behaviors

`examples/poetry` is the executive doing what it exists for: two trees, each a single `LLMCompletionState` with a system prompt, each with a name, a description and an example written for the planner rather than for you.

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/poetry/main.go:behaviors}}
```

The executive gets both trees, a `Preamble` and an `OutOfBoundsHandler`.

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/poetry/main.go:executive}}
```

The rest of `main` is one `RunLoop` call on a `TerminalChannel`, as in the quickstart.

```go
{{#include ../../../examples/poetry/main.go:run}}
```

Run it with `go run ./examples/poetry` and try the three prompts from the file's header comment. This is one session; the poems, and the planner's wording, will differ from run to run.

```text
[User Message]

A haiku about autumn rain

[Assistant Response]

Whispers of the wind,
Golden leaves dance in the rain,
Nature's soft embrace.

[User Message]

A haiku and a sonnet about the sea
$

[Assistant Response]

Waves whisper to shore,
Endless blue, a tranquil sigh,
Secrets deep reside.

Upon the shore where ocean's whispers dwell,
The waves, like courtiers, dance with the breeze,
In twilight's glow, their secrets weave a spell,
As sunbeams glisten on the rolling seas.

With azure depths that cradle dreams untold,
The tides, like time, do ebb and flow with grace,
In tempest's wrath or gentle calm, behold,
The sea's vast heart, a mirror of our place.

It sings of love, of loss, of ancient lore,
A siren's call that beckons from afar,
Each grain of sand, a story to explore,
The moon's soft gaze, a guiding silver star.

So let us wander by the ocean's seam,
For in its depths, we find the pulse of dream.

[User Message]

What's the weather like?
$

[Assistant Response]

Sorry, I only write haikus and sonnets.

[User Message]
```

Each prompt took a different path through `Execute`. The first was a one-step plan, `write_haiku` with a direction restating the topic; the step finished with `nil`, so nothing was kept for the next turn, and the haiku still went through the summarizer before you saw it. The second became a two-step plan, `write_haiku` and `write_sonnet`, which ran at the same time in two goroutines on two tree copies; the summarizer merged the two poems into one reply. The weather question produced an *empty plan*: the `Preamble` told the planner to answer `[]` for anything that is not a poetry request, `Plan` parsed that into no steps, and `Execute` handed the message to `OutOfBoundsHandler`, whose canned text is the reply. No tree ran for that turn, and no summarizer either. This is Chapter 7's out-of-tree selector: one tree per alternative, and `examples/tree-loop`'s hand loop replaced by `RunLoop` plus a planner that picks the tree.

## How it works

### `Plan`

`Plan(ctx, messages)` begins by rendering `executivePlannerPrompt`, a Go `text/template`, with two values: the interpolated `Preamble` and `Behaviors`. For `examples/poetry` the result, with the `Preamble` line left as its placeholder, is this:

```
{{ .Preamble }}

Your job is to plan a series of steps to accomplish a goal given to you by a user.
The steps available to you are the following:

Re-plan: If a plan requires further planning to be complete, end it with this step
write_haiku: Write a haiku (three lines, 5-7-5 syllables) on the topic the user asked for
write_sonnet: Write a Shakespearean sonnet (fourteen rhymed lines) on the topic the user asked for

Return your response as a JSON array of one or more step names to execute in order to accomplish the user's goal.
Each step should consist of the name of the step, as well as extra "direction" or context to accomplish the step accurately given the user's request.
A simple example response could be:

[
   {
      "name": "write_haiku",
      "direction": "Write a haiku about autumn rain"
   }
]

Previous chat history:

...
```

Read the middle. The list of steps is the reserved `Re-plan` followed by one `BehaviorName: BehaviorDescription` line per behavior, and the sample response is the first behavior's name and `Example`. So `BehaviorName` and `BehaviorDescription` are the whole interface between your trees and the planner, which never sees a tree's states; write them like tool descriptions. Only the **first** behavior's `Example` appears, once, as the sample direction; `write_sonnet`'s example, like that of every behavior after the first, is never shown to the planner. And because the template reads struct fields rather than calling `Name()`, `Behaviors` must hold `*BehaviorTree`s (see the sharp edges).

`Preamble` is rendered first, by `interpolatedPreamble`, as an `AnnotationTemplate` (Chapter 4) against the history `Plan` was given, so it may use `{{ $last_message }}` and any annotation on the transcript. A `Preamble` that fails to parse or render panics; there is no error path.

The prompt is then sent through an `LLMCompletionState` in annotation mode, `LLMCompletionOptions{System: prompt, Annotation: "plan"}`, whose `.Lambda` `Plan` invokes directly, bypassing `Call` and its trace envelope (Chapter 5). The history it is handed holds one message, a copy of the last message's `ChatCompletionMessage` with a fresh annotation map. The rest of the transcript reaches the planner only inside the system prompt: the heading `Previous chat history:` is always appended, and once `len(messages) >= 3` the `Content` of up to three messages before the last is listed under it, roles stripped. An `*ErrorSignal` from the call is a `panic(e)`.

`GetAnnotation("plan")` reads the answer back. Chapter 4 explained why it arrives as a raw string: an array does not unmarshal into an `Annotation`, so annotation mode takes its fallback path. `Plan` asserts `Data.(string)` and `json.Unmarshal`s the text into a `[]struct{Name, Direction}`. If that fails, the text goes to `fixJSON`, which asks `gpt-4o-mini` to return a corrected version, inside `util.RetryWithBackoff(…, 3)`: one attempt plus up to three retries with a jittered backoff. The retry's return value is discarded, so if every attempt fails `steps` stays empty, the plan is empty, and `Execute` hands the turn to the `OutOfBoundsHandler`; malformed JSON does not panic here.

Each step's `name` is then looked up in `behaviorLookup`, a map built from `Behaviors` and keyed by `Behavior.Name()`. A hit becomes `&ExecGeneratedStep{Behavior: b.Copy(), Messages: …}`, where the one message is user-role with `Content: step.Direction` and two annotations: `raw_history`, the whole `messages` list at planning time, and `$context`, whatever `messages.GetAnnotation("$context")` returned. A miss whose name lowercases to `re-plan` becomes a `ReplanTombstone` with a `nil` `Behavior` and its direction as its one message. Any other miss is `panic("No plan named … found!")`. Last, a plan consisting only of a tombstone is emptied; there is nothing to re-plan from.

### `Execute`

`Execute(ctx, messages)` reads the plan from `e.plan` and reports back by writing `e.Output` and `e.plan`; it returns nothing. In order:

1. **Empty plan** → the `OutOfBoundsHandler` is called with the last user message and its last message becomes `Output`. With no handler, `Output` is the literal string `Please set an out-of-bounds handler, this request was unable to be planned.` The handler gets a one-message list, a copy of `messages.LastMessage()` with a fresh annotation map, so it starts from the user's words rather than a direction. Either way `Execute` returns here.
2. **Fan out** — `executePlan` starts one goroutine per non-tombstone step and calls `step.Behavior.Call(ctx, step.Messages)`; results are collected through a buffered channel after `WaitGroup.Wait`. Each goroutine writes the returned list back into `step.Messages`, which is how a paused step keeps its own growing transcript, and pushes a `PlanResult{Messages, Step, Signal}` onto the channel. Results arrive in completion order, not plan order, so the summaries below are in whatever order the steps finished.
3. **Triage by signal** — `nil`: the step's last message joins the summaries; `*ErrorSignal`: `"Error occurred: …"` joins the summaries; `*CollectUserInputSignal`: the step is kept for the next turn *and* its last message joins the summaries. Any other signal (a leaked `*SkipSignal`) matches nothing: the step is neither summarized nor kept. (No retry ever happens, Chapter 6.)
4. **Re-plan** — if the last step is a tombstone and nothing is paused: the direction plus all summaries are written into the last user message, `planDepth` is incremented, and `Plan` + `Execute` run again — until `MaxPlanDepth`. The write is literal: `messages[len(messages)-1].Content` becomes the tombstone's direction (or, if the planner left it empty, the user's message) followed by every summary, so the executive's `History` now ends with a rewritten user message, which the next planning call sees as the request. Once `planDepth` reaches `MaxPlanDepth` the rewrite still happens, but `Execute` jumps to the reply step with an empty kept plan. If some step *is* paused, the tombstone is carried into the kept plan behind the paused steps, to fire once they finish; by then `Call` or `RunLoop` will have appended each later user message to it too, so its "direction" is the latest user message.
5. **Reply** — the kept (paused) steps become the new `plan`. If there is exactly one kept entry (a carried `Re-plan` tombstone counts as an entry, so it defeats the shortcut), `Output` is its last message and no model is called. Otherwise a summarizer prompt (`executiveSummarizerPrompt`, or `workInProcessSummarizerPrompt` when steps are still pending) merges the summaries into one reply with another `LLMCompletionState` call. Both prompts open with the interpolated `Preamble`. The finished-plan prompt carries a transcript of `messages`, one `role: content` line per message, then the summaries; the work-in-process prompt asks only to rephrase the summaries as a single question or statement. The call is `.Lambda` on a one-message list, `*messages.LastMessage()`, so the model sees the system prompt and the user's last message. The call's signal is discarded: if the summarizer call fails, the returned list ends with the user's message and that is what `Output` becomes — the executive echoes the user. The `panic("empty last message")` guard covers only an empty list, which this path never produces.

### `Call` and `RunLoop` are twins

Both methods run the same turn: if `plan` is empty, call `Plan`; otherwise append the new user message to each pending step's `Messages`, without planning. Then `Execute`. Then append `Output` to the transcript as an assistant-role message. Apart from its trace envelope, that is the whole of `Call`: it works on the list it is given, never touches `History`, returns the appended list, and always returns `nil` as its signal, whatever happened inside. It is the executive as a nested behavior, and it is what `examples/oneshot` and `examples/snapshot-simple` use, one turn per process. `RunLoop(ctx, channel)` wraps the same dance in `for { Receive; …; Send }` over a `Channel`: it appends what `Receive` returned to `e.History`, runs the turn on `e.History`, appends `Output` to it, and sends `Output` back with the inbound message's `Id`. It returns only when `Receive` or `Send` returns an error, which `TerminalChannel` never does (Chapter 1).

`History`, then, is the executive's transcript: user messages and outputs, in order. Each step's `Messages` is the model's view: the planner's direction, the tree's replies, and every later user message appended on resume. These are Chapter 2's two conversations, kept apart by these two methods.

### `Preamble` as the steering wheel

`Preamble` is the only free-text control you have over the planner, and the examples in this book use it for three things. `examples/snapshot-simple` uses it to keep directions faithful, `When writing the "direction" for a step, restate the user's message faithfully in the third person, quoting it`, which is the fix for the drift Chapter 2 traced. `examples/poetry` uses it to give the assistant an identity, `You are a poetry service`, and to tell the planner when to return `[]`, which is the only deliberate way to reach the `OutOfBoundsHandler`; otherwise it fires only on a lone `Re-plan` or a plan `fixJSON` could not repair. Nothing in `executivePlannerPrompt` invites an empty answer, so without that sentence the planner forces every message onto some behavior. Because `interpolatedPreamble` is also the first line of both summarizer prompts, tone and identity instructions carry into the final reply without being repeated in every state's `System`.

## Coming from LangGraph

The closest LangGraph shape is a supervisor that routes to sub-graphs; the rows for `create_react_agent` and `Send` in Chapter 3 both point here. The difference is cadence. A supervisor picks one worker, waits, and picks again; the executive's planner emits the whole list at once, `executePlan` runs every step in parallel, the way `Send` fans out over a list, and a summarizer joins the results. There is no ReAct interleaving inside the executive: a tree cannot ask the planner for another step mid-run, and the only iterative element is `Re-plan`, which folds the summaries back into the request and plans again, bounded by `MaxPlanDepth`. Selection is prompt-and-parse, not function calling (Chapter 3), so a misspelt name is a panic, not a correction. The mapping breaks at the decision itself: in LangGraph your code decides how many branches a `Send` produces and which worker a supervisor calls, while here the planning model decides both, by writing more or fewer steps, and your only lever is the prompt.

## Sharp edges

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
`Behaviors` must hold `*BehaviorTree`s. The planner prompt is a `text/template` that renders `{{ .BehaviorName }}: {{ .BehaviorDescription }}` — the tree's struct fields, not the `Behavior` interface's `Name()`/`Description()` methods. A bare `*BehaviorState`, or a nested `*TodoListExecutive` (whose fields are `ExecName`/`ExecDescription`), makes `Plan` panic while rendering the prompt (`can't evaluate field BehaviorName`), before any model call. Wrap anything that is not a tree in a one-state tree.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
`Plan` panics on model misbehavior: a plan whose `data` field is not a string (`could not put a plan together!`), a missing annotation (`no valid plan annotation!`), a step naming a behavior that does not exist (`No plan named … found!`), and an error from the planning call. There is no `recover` in the framework, so one bad plan takes down the process. Until this is fixed, keep behavior names short and distinct, and put a `recover` in the goroutine that calls `RunLoop`.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
Behaviors are matched by `Name()`, case-sensitively; `re-plan` is matched case-insensitively. Two behaviors with the same name silently shadow each other (last one wins), and a behavior named `Re-plan` silently disables re-planning (it wins the lookup before the tombstone check).
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
`fixJSON` constructs `llm.OpenAIService{}` directly with `gpt-4o-mini`. The planner, the summarizer and the JSON repair all default to OpenAI regardless of what model your states use, so `OPENAI_TOKEN` is required for any executive.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
`Copy()` on an executive dereferences `OutOfBoundsHandler` without a nil check and copies configuration only — not `History`, `plan` or `Output`. The Go core never calls it (only the Lua binding's `copy` can): `Behaviors` must hold trees, and `BehaviorTree.Copy` shares its nodes by pointer, so an executive wrapped in a tree is *shared* by every plan step and every turn, keeping its `plan` between them, and because `Call` always returns `nil`, a pause inside it never pauses the enclosing tree. Set `OutOfBoundsHandler` anyway, and do not nest an executive that pauses.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
`Output` is a side channel — `Execute` returns nothing and communicates by mutating it (the field carries the author's `FIXME`). Read it only immediately after `Execute`, or use `Call`, which appends it to the messages for you.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
An empty `Preamble` is not empty in the prompt. `AnnotationTemplate.Parse("")` decodes one rune from an empty string, gets `utf8.RuneError`, and emits a text block containing U+FFFD, so `interpolatedPreamble` puts a `�` at the top of the planner and summarizer prompts whenever `Preamble` is unset (as in the quickstart). Set a one-line `Preamble` on every executive.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
The single-step shortcut tests `len(e.plan) == 1` on the *kept* plan — the paused steps. If one step finished and another paused in the same turn, the kept plan has one entry, the shortcut fires, and the finished step's output never reaches the user: it sits in the summaries list that the shortcut skips. Design around it: do not mix a pausing behavior with a completing one in the same request unless losing the completed output is acceptable. The exception is a plan that ended in `Re-plan`: the tombstone makes two entries and the summarizer sees both outputs.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
The planner sees only the latest message of `History` and up to three before it, not the whole transcript. Long-range context has to reach the behaviors through the step's own messages (which grow on resume) or through annotations, not through the planner.
```

```admonish warning title="Sharp edge"
User text reaches the planner and summarizer prompts inside `System`, which `LLMCompletionState` parses as an `AnnotationTemplate`. A message containing an unclosed `{{` makes `Plan` panic on the next turns it is quoted, and makes every finished-plan summarizer call fail; `{{ name }}` in user text is substituted away. Escape braces in `History` before the executive sees them.
```

## The trace, re-read

Chapter 2 asked you to read it twice. Here is the second reading, in the vocabulary of Part II.

**Step 1 — Receive.** `RunLoop` blocks in `Channel.Receive`; `TerminalChannel` prints `[User Message]` and returns your lines as one `ChannelMessage`. `RunLoop` wraps the content as a user-role message and appends it to `e.History` with `AppendToMessages`, which gives it an empty, non-nil annotation map.

**Step 2 — Plan.** `len(e.plan)` is zero, so `RunLoop` calls `Plan(ctx, e.History)`, which renders `executivePlannerPrompt` with `chat_behavior: A conversational bot` as the only behavior line under the reserved `Re-plan` and has an `LLMCompletionState` in annotation mode pin the model's JSON onto your one message under `plan`. The one step it parses out becomes a `Copy()` of `chatBehavior` plus one user-role message holding the planner's direction.

**Step 3 — Execute, fan out.** `Execute(ctx, e.History)` hands the one-step plan to `executePlan`, which starts one goroutine, calls `step.Behavior.Call(ctx, step.Messages)`, and collects the `PlanResult` through the buffered channel after `WaitGroup.Wait`.

**Step 4 — The tree walks its states.** `BehaviorTree.Call` finds an empty `State` stack, pushes `Graph.Initial()`, which is `chatState`, and resets `Traversed`. `chatState` sends the direction to `gpt-4o-mini`, appends the reply, and returns `nil`; the tree pushes `pauseState`, pops it, and gets a `*CollectUserInputSignal`, so it pushes the pause state's children (there are none) and returns the messages and the signal with the stack still empty.

**Step 5 — Execute decides the reply.** Triage matches `*CollectUserInputSignal`: the step is kept in the new `plan` and its last message joins the summaries. The kept plan has one entry, so the single-step shortcut sets `Output` to that message, resets `planDepth`, and returns without a summarizer call.

**Step 6 — Send.** `RunLoop` appends `Output` to `e.History` as an assistant-role message and calls `Channel.Send`; `TerminalChannel` prints `[Assistant Response]` and the text. `History` holds two messages, `plan` holds one paused step, and `RunLoop` returns to `Receive`.

**Step 7 — The next turn.** Your second message is appended to `e.History`, but `len(e.plan)` is one, so `Plan` is skipped and `RunLoop` appends `e.History.LastMessage()` to `step.Messages` instead. `Execute` calls the same tree copy; its stack is empty, so `BehaviorTree.Call` restarts from `chatState` on the three-message list, `pauseState` pauses again, the step is kept again, and the shortcut sets `Output` again.

Everything on that page is now something you have built or read.

```admonish example title="Recap"
- The executive holds a flat list of behaviors; a planning LLM picks steps by **name** and writes each a **direction**.
- Steps run concurrently on `Copy()`s; signals decide whether a step is summarized, kept for next turn, or reported as an error.
- One paused step → its last message is the reply; otherwise a summarizer call merges results.
- `Call` and `RunLoop` are the same turn; `RunLoop` adds the channel loop.
- `BehaviorName`/`BehaviorDescription` and `Preamble` are the interface to the planner. Always set `OutOfBoundsHandler` and a `Preamble`.
```
